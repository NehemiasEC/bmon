# Parameters that are State-type values instead of continuous analog values.

    Parameters
    ----------
    url:  The base URL including port (if not port 80) for the OkoFEN boiler.
        e.g. http://64.189.233.145:8888
    site_id: A string to identify this particular boiler, e.g. 'Haines_boiler1'.  Used to
        create Sensor IDs for each of the readings.
    tz_data:  Olson Timezone string indicating what timezone the boiler data is represented
        in.  Sometimes, the timezone of the boiler is set to a value not consistent with
        where the boiler is located.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones
        for valid timezone string values.
    last_date_loaded: This is the date in YYYY-MM-DD format of the last CSV file loaded by
        the script.  The script will try to load CSV files timestamped after that date, but
        no further in the past than 2 weeks.
    kwargs:  No other keyword arguments are used.

    Returns
    -------
    A dictionary with the following keys are values:
        readings: A list of sensor readings in the Periodic Script format
            (ts, Sensor ID, value)
        last_date_loaded: A date string like '2016-11-22' that indicated the date
            of the last CSV file successfully loaded
        errors: A string listing any errors that occurred while fetching data.
        sensor_ids: A comma-separated string of the sensor IDs that were read for
            the last CSV file loaded.
