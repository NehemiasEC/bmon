Transform Expressions
=====================

Transform Expressions are used for a number of purposes, including:

*  Sensor values may arrive expressed in units that are not desirable. A
   Transform Expression can be used to convert the units to the type
   desired for display.
*  Sensor values may have known errors that can be corrected with a
   Transform Expression before storage into the system.
*  Pulse counts generally should be converted into a rate value
   (units/second or units/hour), as counts do not always arrive at equal
   intervals due to wireless transmission issues and due to users
   changing the time interval that a sensor reports. Special Transform
   Expressions can be used to convert the pulse counts into a rate
   value.

Simple Transform Expressions
----------------------------

Transform Expressions are entered on the Sensor editing screen. The
screenshot below shows a Transform Expression to adjust the
reading from a Light Sensor, correcting for light reducing paint that
covers the sensor.

In the ``Transform or Calculated Field Function Name`` box you can see
the transform expression ``val*35.0 - 140.0``. The variable ``val`` is
always available in a Transform Expression and it contains the raw
sensor value that was posted. This transform multiplies that raw value
by 35.0 and then subtracts 140.0. When creating these expressions, you
have all the `built-in
functions <https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html>`_ (e.g.
``abs()`` for absolute value, ) from the Python programming language
plus the functions available in the `Python math
module <https://docs.python.org/2/library/math.html>`_ (e.g. ``sqrt()``,
``sin()``, ``log10()``). So, an expression such as
``sqrt(val)/(val - 8.6)`` is a valid transform expression.

In the above screenshot, note that the ``Calculated Field`` box is
**not** checked. This is not a new calculated field, created from other
sensor values or the gathered from the Internet. Instead, this is just a
conversion of an incoming sensor value.

Pulse Counter Transforms
------------------------

Electric meters, gas meters, water meters, and fuel meters often produce
pulses as a means of electronically communicating flow through the
meter. Each pulse represents a fixed amount of energy or volume of
material flowing through the meter. The pulse output of the meter can be
connected to a pulse counter that reports total pulse counts to the BMON
system. It is generally desirable to convert these pulse count totals
into a rate of flow of energy, fluid, or gas. By converting to a rate
(units/second), variations in the length of the interval measured by
the pulse counter are factored out of the measured value.

Special pulse counter Transform features were developed to address this
situation. The recommended setting for a pulse counter is to have it
continually accumulate pulse counts, only resetting to zero when a
maximum rollover pulse count is reached. If your pulse counter is set up
in this way, below is an example of how you can transform the total
pulse count values into a usable rate value. In this example, a natural
gas meter is being read, and a pulse occurs for each CCF of gas passing
through the meter. Our objective is to convert the pulse count readings
into a gas flow measured in Btu/hour.

The BMON Transform feature has a special variable named ``rate``. If a
Transform expression uses this variable, BMON knows that a pulse count
is being measured, and BMON automatically calculates the pulse rate per
second indicated by the last pulse count reading received relative to
the prior pulse count reading. This pulse rate is stored in the variable
``rate``. As an example, assume that the last pulse count received was a
total count of 10,435. The prior pulse count reading from the sensor was
9,623 and it was received 605 seconds prior to the current reading. The
pulse rate that occurred between the two readings was
``(10435 - 9623) / 605 = 1.342 pulses/second``. This value of 1.342 is
automatically stored in the ``rate`` variable.

So continuing with the example, we know that BMON has already calculated
pulse rate per second for the gas meter. We also know that one CCF of
gas contains 1,010 Btus. To convert the pulse rate into Btus/hour we
would do the following:

::

    rate (pulses/sec)  *  1,010 Btus/pulse  *  3,600 sec/hour
    
	which is rate * 3636000
    

``rate * 3636000`` is the expression shown in the
``Transform or Calculated Field Function Name`` box.

There are couple other optional but often important parameters that can
be entered in the ``Function Parameters in YAML form`` box:

``max_rate`` (default value = 5.0, expressed as pulses/second): 
Pulse count reporting errors (one common issue described below) can
sometimes lead to an erroneous high pulse rate calculation. BMON will
not save any sensor values if the pulse rate is above this ``max_rate``
value. For the example above, a maximum pulse rate 1.5 pulses per second
is set. This corresponds to a 5,454,000 Btu/hour rate. Reported sensor
values will be rejected if they exceed this rate. Note that there is a
default ``max_rate`` value of 5.0 pulses/second if you do not provide a
value in the ``Function Parameters`` box.

``rollover`` (default value = 65536, largest 16 bit value): 
Pulse counters usually have a maximum pulse count that they record before
rolling over to zero. BMON will account for this rollover when
calculating the pulse rate. Year 2014 and prior `Monnit wireless pulse
counters <http://www.monnit.com/ProductSearch?SortBy=Rank&Asc=False+&PageSize=12&ProductCategory=1&SensorType=32&SensorProfile=30>`_
roll over at a count of 65,536, the default value for this parameter.
Newer Monnit pulse counters are 32 bit and roll over at 4,294,967,296.
If you expect your pulse counter to eventually roll over, you need to
ensure that BMON is using the correct ``rollover`` value.

``ignore_zero`` (default value = ``True``, the other valid value is
``False``): Monnit Wireless pulse counters occasionally reset to a pulse
count of zero if there are transmission problems or an accidental reset
of the sensor. So, the pulse count value of zero is usually an erroneous
value. By leaving this ``ignore_zero`` parameter at its default value of
``True``, these zero pulse count readings will be ignored and no value
will be stored until the next valid reading.

``ignore_negative`` (default value = ``True``, the other valid value is
``False``): If set to ``True`` a backward movement of the counter is ignored
(it could be due to a reset).  If this parameter is ``False``, a backward
movement of the counter is reported as a negative rate of change.

``min_interval`` (default value = 60, measured in seconds): Monnit
wireless pulse counters sometimes send the same pulse count value twice
but with slight separation in time, resulting in a zero calculated pulse
rate. To filter out these erroneous readings you can set a
``min_interval`` between valid readings, measured in seconds. If two
successive readings are separated by less than this number of seconds,
the second reading will be rejected. The default value is 60 seconds.

Also note that all readings that use this pulse count transform are
time-stamped at the midpoint between the current reading time and the
previous reading time, since the rate reported is derived from the
interval spanning those two time points.

--------------

If your pulse counter is setup to reset to zero after it reports its
pulse count (Monnit wireless pulse counters 2013 and earlier), a
different Transform function must be used to convert the counter values
into rates. This is not the preferred method for setting up a pulse
counter but may be needed for those counters that do not have a count
accumulation mode, as described in the prior section.

The screenshot below is an example of configuring a counter that resets to
zero after each sensor report.

The text ``count_rate`` must be entered into the
``Transform or Calculated Field Function Name`` box. Then, additional
parameters are entered into the ``Function Parameters in YAML form``
box. Each parameter has a default value, so they are not required to be
entered, but you will likely need to override some of the default
values.

``slope`` (default value = 1.0)
``offset`` (default value = 0.0): BMON will automatically convert
the incoming pulse count into a rate of pulses per second. The
``slope`` and ``offset`` parameters are used to convert this pulse
rate into the desired engineering units, such as Btu/hour or kW. The
final value stored in the sensor database is:
``(pulse rate per second) * slope + offset``

``typical_minutes`` (default value = 30.0, measured in minutes):
Sensor transmissions are sometimes missed or occur multiple times due to
poor signal strength. The BMON attempts to correct some of these
problems but needs to know what the *typical* spacing is between sensor
transmission. Enter that value expressed in minutes for this parameter.

``no_zero_after_link`` (default value = ``True``, other possible
value is ``False``): If a Monnit wireless sensor is having difficulty
communicating with its gateway, it will sleep for two hours and then try
to reestablish contact. When it does this, it will send an initial count
of zero. By setting ``no_zero_after_link`` to ``True`` (the default
value), these zero readings will not be stored in the sensor database.
