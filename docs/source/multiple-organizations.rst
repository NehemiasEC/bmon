Sharing the BMON Server across Multiple Organizations
=====================================================

One BMON server can be used to serve multiple Organizations. If this
multiple-organization feature is used, an Organization drop-down selector
will appear at the top of the BMON page, as shown in the screenshot
below:

To set up multiple organizations, add Organizations using the link
shown in the screenshot below:

When you add a new Organzation, you will be presented with inputs that
require you to identify which Buildings, Building Groups, Multi-Building
Charts, and Custom Reports belong to the Organization. If the BMON user
chooses this Organization, only these items will be displayed in the
BMON user interface.
